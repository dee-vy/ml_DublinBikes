# ml_DublinBikes

To evaluate the feasibility of predicting Dublin bike station occupancy at the time, 10 mins, 30 mins and 1 hour into the future. 
The model showed a minimum of 95\% accuracy hence making it highly feasible.

Two models compared: Ridge and kNN. Baseline assumes that the prediction will be similar to the current values.
Two contrasting stations chosen for evaluation: Grangegorman Lower (South) and Hanover Quay.
